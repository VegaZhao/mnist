# mnist
This is a primary practice in kaggle called mnist.
1. Using matlab to process data, the code is data_process.m.
2. Using caffe to train model, which network is a classical LeNet with a little modification.
3. Finally, using python to get final predicts of all test data, the code is result.py.

In addition, I use oversample.m to oversample train data, but don't get an improvement.
